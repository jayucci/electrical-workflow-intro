Hello, my name is Jayden Sumbillo and I’m currently a second-year Electrical Engineering student. My goals for the Spring 22 semester are to finish up the last section of my prerequisites and hopefully gain experience for a summer internship. I wish to learn as much as I can through this club and I hope to contribute my best efforts! I’m looking forward to the semester!
